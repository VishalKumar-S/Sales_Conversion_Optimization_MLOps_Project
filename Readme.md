# Project Description 🚀

Welcome to the Sales Conversion Optimization Project! 📈 This project focuses on enhancing sales conversion rates through meticulous data handling and efficient model training. The goal is to optimize conversions using a structured pipeline and predictive modeling.

We've structured this project to streamline the process from data ingestion and cleaning to model training and evaluation. With an aim to empower efficient decision-making, our pipelines incorporate quality validation tests, drift analysis, and rigorous model performance evaluations.

This project aims to streamline your sales conversion process, providing insights and predictions to drive impactful business decisions! 📊✨

# Train Pipeline 🚂

In this pipeline, we embark on a journey through various steps to train our models! 🛤️ Here's the process breakdown:

1. **run_pipeline.py**: Initiates the training pipeline.
2. **steps/ingest_Data**: Ingests the data, sending it to the data_validation step.
3. **data_validation step**: Conducts validation tests and transforms values.
4. **steps/clean_Data**: Carries out data preprocessing logics.
5. **data_Drift_validation step**: Conducts data drift tests.
6. **steps/train_model.py**: Utilizes h2o.ai AUTOML for model selection.
7. **src/train_models.py**: Implements the best model on the cleaned dataset.
8. **model_performance_Evaluation.py**: Assesses model performance on a split dataset.
9. **steps/email_report.py**: Here, if any of teh validation test suites, didn't meet the threshold condition, email will be sent to the user, along with the failed Evidently.AI generated HTML reports.

Each step is crucial in refining and validating our model. All aboard the train pipeline! 🌟🚆

# Continuous Integration Pipeline ⚙️

The continuous integration pipeline focuses on the production environment and streamlined processes for deployment. 🔄

Here's how it flows:

1. **ci-cd.py**: Triggered to initiate the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **steps/production_batch_data**: Accesses production batch data from the Production_data folder
3. **pipelines/continuous_integration.py**: As we already discussed earlier, we conduct Data Quality, Data Drift as previously we did, if threshold fails, email reports are sent.
4. **steps/predict_production_Data.py**: Utilizes the pre-trained best model to make predictions on new production data. Then, we conduct Model Performance validation as previously we did, if threshold fails, email reports are sent.

This pipeline is crucial for maintaining a continuous and reliable deployment process. 🔁✨

## Email Reports 📧

In our project, email reports are a vital part of the pipeline to notify users when certain tests fail. These reports are triggered by specific conditions during the pipeline execution. Here's how it works:

### E-mail Details

Upon data quality or data drift test or model performance validation tests failures, an email is generated detailing:

- Number of total tests performed.
- Number of passed and failed tests.
- Failed test reports attached in HTML format.


### Integration with Pipeline Steps

This email functionality is integrated into the pipeline steps via Python scripts (`steps/email_report.py`). If a particular test threshold fails, the execution pauses and an email is dispatched. Successful test completions proceed to the next step in the pipeline.

This notification system helps ensure the integrity and reliability of the data processing and model performance at each stage of the pipeline.

# Prediction App 🚀

The Prediction App is the user-facing interface that leverages the trained models to make predictions based on user input. 🎯
To run the streamlit application,
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
